# P4-Implementation-of-ChatBot-using-NLP

This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot application leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner, showcasing the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in building interactive systems.

## Features âœ¨
- **Intent Recognition:** Accurately identifies user intents for dynamic conversations.
- **Context Handling:** Maintains context across multiple interactions for a seamless user experience.
- **Pretrained Models:** Utilizes cutting-edge NLP models like **Transformer-based architectures** (e.g., BERT, GPT) or rule-based approaches.
- **Customizable Responses:** Easily adaptable to various use cases such as customer service, FAQs, or virtual assistants.

## Project Highlights ðŸ“Œ
- **Tokenization and Preprocessing:** Text data is processed for efficient understanding using stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Trained with classification models for intent recognition and sequence-to-sequence models for response generation.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Offers a simple, user-friendly interface for engaging with the chatbot.
- **Extensive Training Dataset:** Supports multiple domains with diverse datasets for enhanced accuracy.

## Tech Stack ðŸ’»
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Frameworks & Libraries: **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **NLTK**, **spaCy**
- Deployment: **Flask/Django** (for the backend), **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for the frontend)


## Applications ðŸš€
